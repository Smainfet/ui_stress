An experimental study was carried out on 74 subjects recorded in two states: an initial state of relaxation followed by a phase of stress where the subject performs different stressful tasks (mental calculation, stroop test which is a color game). Four physiological signals including: ECG, PPG, EDA and EMG are recorded during both phases.

As part of this work, I worked on PPG signal preprocessing. I developed a processing chain including: Exploratory data analysis, PPG signal processing and extraction of temporal, frequency and statistical parameters.
